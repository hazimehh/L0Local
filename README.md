# L0L-OMG: L0 Localized-Optimal Medical Groups
## Hussein Hazimeh, Matthew Sobiesk, and Rebecca Zhang

This package fits L0-regularized local logistic regression models. It was developed with medical applications in mind, as part of the [MLHC](https://mlhc19mit.github.io) class at MIT. The package is built in C++ with an R interface -- it is based on [L0Learn](https://github.com/hazimehh/L0Learn).

More details on the models and usage to be added soon.
