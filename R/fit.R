#' @title Fit an L0-regularized model
#'
#' @description Computes the regularization path for the specified loss function and
#' penalty function (which can be a combination of the L0, L1, and L2 norms).
#' @param x The data matrix.
#' @param y The response vector.
#' @param loss The loss function to be minimized. Currently we support the choice "SquaredError".
#' @param penalty The type of regularization. This can take either one of the following choices:
#' "L0", "L0L2", and "L0L1".
#' @param algorithm The type of algorithm used to minimize the objective function. Currently "CD" and "CDPSI" are
#' are supported. "CD" is a variant of cyclic coordinate descent and runs very fast. "CDPSI" performs
#' local combinatorial search on top of CD and typically achieves higher quality solutions (at the expense
#' of increased running time).
#' @param maxSuppSize The maximum support size at which to terminate the regularization path. We recommend setting
#' this to a small fraction of min(n,p) (e.g. 0.05 * min(n,p)) as L0 regularization typically selects a small
#' portion of non-zeros.
#' @param nLambda The number of Lambda values to select (recall that Lambda is the regularization parameter
#' corresponding to the L0 norm).
#' @param nGamma The number of Gamma values to select (recall that Gamma is the regularization parameter
#' corresponding to L1 or L2, depending on the chosen penalty).
#' @param gammaMax The maximum value of Gamma when using the L0L2 penalty. For the L0L1 penalty this is
#' automatically selected.
#' @param gammaMin The minimum value of Gamma when using the L0L2 penalty. For the L0L1 penalty, the minimum
#' value of gamma in the grid is set to gammaMin * gammaMax. Note that this should be a strictly positive quantity.
#' @param partialSort If TRUE partial sorting will be used for sorting the coordinates to do greedy cycling (see our paper for
#' for details). Otherwise, full sorting is used.
#' @param maxIters The maximum number of iterations (full cycles) for CD per grid point.
#' @param tol The tolerance which decides when to terminate CD (based on the relative change in the objective).
#' @param activeSet If TRUE, performs active set updates.
#' @param activeSetNum The number of consecutive times a support should appear before declaring support stabilization.
#' @param maxSwaps The maximum number of swaps used by CDPSI for each grid point.
#' @param scaleDownFactor This parameter decides how close the selected Lambda values are. The choice should be between
#' strictly between 0 and 1 (i.e., 0 and 1 are not allowed). Larger values lead to closer lambdas and typically to smaller
#' gaps between the support sizes. For details, see our paper - Section 5 on Adaptive Selection of Tuning Parameters).
#' @param screenSize The number of coordinates to cycle over when performing initial correlation screening.
#' @param autoLambda If FALSE, the user specifier a grid of Lambda values through the lambdaGrid parameter. Otherwise,
#' if TRUE, the values of Lambda are automatically selected based on the data.
#' @param lambdaGrid A vector of Lambda values to use in computing the regularization path. This is ignored unless autoLambda = FALSE.
#' @param excludeFirstK This parameter takes non-negative integers. The first excludeFirstK features in x will be excluded from variable selection,
#' i.e., the first excludeFirstK variables will not be included in the L0-norm penalty (they will still be included in the L1 or L2 norm penalties.).
#' @param intercept If FALSE, no intercept term is included in the model.
#' @param weights A vector of weights used for weighted likelihood/regression. weight[i] is associated with the ith sample.
#' @return An S3 object of type "L0Learn" describing the regularization path. The object has the following members.
#' \item{a0}{a0 is a list of intercept sequences. The ith element of the list (i.e., a0[[i]]) is the sequence of intercepts corresponding to the ith gamma value (i.e., gamma[i]).}
#' \item{beta}{This is a list of coefficient matrices. The ith element of the list is a p x \code{length(lambda)} matrix which
#' corresponds to the ith gamma value. The jth column in each coefficient matrix is the vector of coefficients for the jth lambda value.}
#' \item{lambda}{This is the list of lambda sequences used in fitting the model. The ith element of lambda (i.e., lambda[[i]]) is the sequence
#' of Lambda values corresponding to the ith gamma value.}
#' \item{gamma}{This is the sequence of gamma values used in fitting the model.}
#' \item{suppSize}{This is a list of support size sequences. The ith element of the list is a sequence of support sizes (i.e., number of non-zero coefficients)
#' corresponding to the ith gamma value.}
#' \item{converged}{This is a list of sequences for checking whether the algorithm has converged at every grid point. The ith element of the list is a sequence
#' corresponding to the ith value of gamma, where the jth element in each sequence indicates whether the algorithm has converged at the jth value of lambda.}
